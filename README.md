# **Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction**

## Business Problem

Hotel booking cancellations can impact revenue and operational efficiency for hotels. Predicting which bookings are likely to be canceled can help hotels optimize their resources, such as staffing and room allocation. By identifying potential cancellations early, hotels can take proactive measures to mitigate their impact and optimize their operations.

## Solution Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not. The model utilizes historical data about hotel bookings, including customer demographics, booking details, and past cancellation patterns. By analyzing this data, the model learns patterns and trends that can help it make accurate predictions about future cancellations.

## How the Model Works
1. Data Collection: Historical data about hotel bookings is collected, including information such as customer demographics, booking details, and cancellation history.
2. Data Preprocessing: The collected data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove any inconsistencies or missing values. This step ensures that the data is ready for model training.
3. Model Training: The preprocessed data is used to train a machine learning model. Various algorithms, such as logistic regression or random forest, can be used for this task. The model learns from the historical data to identify patterns and relationships between different features and the likelihood of a booking being canceled.
4. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This step ensures that the model is making accurate predictions and generalizes well to new data.
5. Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to a web application or other platforms where it can be used to make predictions in real-time.
