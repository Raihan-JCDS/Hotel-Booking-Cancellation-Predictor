Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict hotel booking cancellations based on various features related to the booking information. The dataset contains information about hotel bookings, including features such as country of origin, market segment, previous cancellations, booking changes, deposit type, days in waiting list, customer type, reserved room type, required car parking space, total special requests, and whether the booking was canceled or not.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

app.py: Streamlit web application for user interaction and prediction.
model.pkl: Pickle file containing the trained machine learning model.
cleaned_df.csv: Cleaned dataframe containing the preprocessed data.
requirements.txt: Text file containing the required Python libraries and dependencies.
README.md: Markdown file providing an overview of the project.
Setup and Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/hotel-booking-cancellation-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd hotel-booking-cancellation-prediction
Install the required Python libraries and dependencies using pip:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit web application:
arduino
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Access the web application by opening the provided URL in your web browser.
Usage
Once the web application is running, users can interact with it to predict hotel booking cancellations. They can input various features related to the booking information, such as country of origin, market segment, previous cancellations, etc., and click the "Predict" button to view the prediction result.

Model Training
The machine learning model used for prediction is trained using the cleaned dataset. The training process involves preprocessing the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, training the model using the training data, and evaluating its performance using the testing data. The trained model is then saved as a pickle file (model.pkl) for later use in prediction.
